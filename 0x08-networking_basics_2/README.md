# Networking basics #1
## Project 0x08 - Foundations - System engineering & DevOps
The term network refers to a set of independent computer systems connected to each other, in such a way that they allow an exchange of data, for which it is necessary both the physical connection and the logical connection of the systems. The latter is established by means of special network protocols, such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). Two computers connected to each other can already be considered a network.

The networks are configured with the objective of transmitting data from one system to another or to have resources in common, such as servers, databases or printers. Depending on the size and scope of the computer network, a differentiation between different network dimensions can be established. Among the most important types of networks are:

 - Personal Area Networks (PAN) or personal area network
 - Local Area Networks (LAN) or local area network
 - Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN) or metropolitan area network
 - Wide Area Networks (WAN) or wide area network
 - Global Area Networks (GAN) or global area network

## Learning Objectives:
 - What is localhost/127.0.0.1
 - What is 0.0.0.0
 - What is /etc/hosts
 - How to display your machineâ€™s active network interfaces
## Requirements:
 - All your files should end with a new line
 - A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
 - All your Bash script files must be executable
 - Your Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.3-1~ubuntu14.04.1 via apt-get) without any errors
 - The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/env bash```
 - The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

### More Info:
The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

For multiple choice question type tasks, just type the number of the correct answer in your answer file, add a new line for every new answer, example:
